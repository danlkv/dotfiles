# Homebrew

This installs to a custom prefix `~/.local/linuxbrew`, which forces homebrew to
install everything from source. This results in a slower installation.

Overall, it's not clear how to properly install homebrew without any root
rights, such that the binaries are downloaded.


## Known Issues

- Doesn't work on alpine linux, fails to install portable ruby.
